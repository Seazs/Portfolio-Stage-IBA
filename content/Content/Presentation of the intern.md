# Small presentation

My name is bienfait alexandre and I'm currently between MA1 and MA2 of my engineering degree. last year I started my master's degree in computer science with an option in computational intelligence. 

I knew that i wanted to do an internship for a long time as I really wanted to have a first real experience as an computer science engineer. I felt that the potential experience of an internship could be way more interesting than 2 courses at the university.

# Research of an internship

I started looking at companies to do my placement in Q1 of my MA1, but without finding any real opportunities or that I was interested in. I knew that the job fair organized by the Ecole Polytechnique de Bruxelles would bring a lot of interesting solution.

My first choices was to work in the Space industry, and that's why i got really excited when i talked with someone from **Space Application** who was interested in my profil. However, although I kept in touch with him, I never managed to get a reply from him, the company or even his colleague.


# How i got into the internship


At the Job Fair I spoke to a number of companies, including IBA. When I first heard about IBA, I was immediately drawn to the idea of working on something as impactful as proton therapy. The technology is fascinating, and I found it impressive to work in a company at the cutting edge of technology in its field.

Luckily, I know someone who works there and as soon as I sent him my CV and asked if he knew of any internship opportunities, I got an email asking if I was available for an interview.
