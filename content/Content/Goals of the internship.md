The internship involves improving an application developed by an intern "client". This Python application is used to download, install and launch a number of other **python** applications used on site for the maintenance or testing of IBA equipment. Currently, the launcher imposes an old version of Python as well as a version of dependencies on the other applications. The aim is to make it more adaptive.
