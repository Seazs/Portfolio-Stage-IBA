I don't have any concrete traces of evaluation but here are some feedback that i receive during my internship.

During the second week of my internship, my supervisor went on vacation. Before leaving, he asked me to create an initial comparison table of all the solutions I could find regarding the main problem of our application: how to manage multiple Python environments automatically without consuming too much storage space. To create this comparative table, he requested that I conduct preliminary implementation tests (essentially proof of concept) for these solutions.

I spent the following two weeks doing just that. I assessed the advantages and consequences of each solution based on the tests I performed and the documentation I found online.

When he returned from vacation two weeks later, I presented my findings to Adrien and Valentin, who were impressed to see how much progress I had made and that the tests I had conducted were already conclusive and well-developed.

Following these initial two weeks and the tests I conducted, we found ourselves somewhat stuck on optimizing the application's storage space. As explained in [[Technical content]], we faced a storage issue.

The team leader suggested that I add a point to the next dayâ€™s weekly meeting agenda, so I could first explain my project to the rest of the team, who might not have been fully aware of what I was working on, and then present my problem to see if anyone had ideas.

I prepared a presentation in English using PowerPoint to provide a visual aid.

The presentation went very well, and although no immediate solutions were found, a colleague reached out to me the following day with a suggestion he had come up with.

Both my supervisor and the team leader were very pleased and impressed with my presentation, especially considering I had limited time to prepare for it.
