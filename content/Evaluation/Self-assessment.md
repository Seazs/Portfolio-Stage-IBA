# Self-Assessment

## **Positive Aspects:**

1. **Proficient Skills:**  
    I possessed all the necessary skills to complete the tasks assigned to me, and I was able to quickly learn any missing knowledge. This ability to adapt ensured that I could tackle various challenges effectively.
    
2. **Rapid Learning of New Technologies:**  
    I demonstrated a quick aptitude for learning new technologies. This flexibility allowed me to stay up-to-date with the latest tools and methodologies, contributing to the overall success of my projects.
    
3. **Delivering a Convincing Final Product:**  
    I believe I delivered a final product that is not only convincing but also reusable for future projects. This reflects my commitment to quality and my understanding of the project's long-term goals.
    
4. **Clear and Precise Communication:**  
    I maintained clear and precise communication during my presentations to the team. This skill helped ensure that everyone was on the same page and that my ideas were understood.
    
5. **Punctuality and Responsibility:**  
    I am punctual and take my responsibilities seriously. I did not hesitate to stay longer to complete tasks if they were not finished, demonstrating my dedication to my work.
    
6. **Engagement in My Tasks:**  
    I was fully engaged in my tasks, showing enthusiasm and commitment to achieving the project objectives. This involvement not only benefited my work but also positively impacted the team.
    
7. **Utilization of Diagrams for Clarity:**  
    I used various diagrams to explain my code and the architecture of my application. These visual aids were particularly effective in illustrating the connections and communications between different parts of my work.
    
8. **Consistent Punctuality:**  
    I am consistently punctual and rarely arrive late. This reliability fosters a positive work environment and shows respect for my colleagues’ time.

## **Negative Aspects:**

1. **Difficulty in Problem-Solving:**  
    I sometimes find myself spending too long stuck on a problem without attempting to find alternative solutions. This can hinder my progress and delay project timelines.
    
2. **Lack of Contextual Awareness:**  
    I occasionally forget that my colleagues may not be as familiar with my project as I am, making it necessary to recontextualise information. I need to improve my communication in this regard to ensure everyone is aligned before going deeper in my explanation.
    
3. **Introverted Nature:**  
    Being naturally introverted and shy, I sometimes struggle to engage with others, whether it’s joining them for lunch or participating in activities outside of work. The presence of other interns did not motivate me to socialize more, and it was only towards the end of my internship that I felt fully comfortable with my team. This is somewhat unfortunate, as building those connections earlier could have enriched my experience.
    
4. **Self-Trust and Validation:**  
    I need to work on trusting myself more and not relying on validation from my peers. Developing this self-confidence will help me make decisions more independently and assertively.
