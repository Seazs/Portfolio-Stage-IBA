We have a meeting every week with my supervisor and the intern client Valentin. In every meeting, I will :
- do a recall of what was discussed last week
- present what i have achieved during the week
- discuss the problems and difficulty that i have
- plan what i will do during the following week

Each week, I received feedback on my work from the previous week. This allowed me to make adjustments and correct my work or adapt my approach if something wasnâ€™t quite right.

Fortunately, I rarely received any critiques on my work style, productivity, or behavior; the feedback was primarily focused on the technical aspects.

During my review, one suggestion that both my supervisor and I highlighted was the need for more diagrams to illustrate processes or code architecture. This is something I worked to implement throughout the remainder of my internship.

i made mermaid flowchart for the [[Technical content#**Publishing application to the ProteusToolbox**|automated publishing pipeline]] and for the [[Technical content#Generic windows installer for python application|Generic windows installer for python application]] which allow to easily see the pipe of information passing through the different phases of the process.
