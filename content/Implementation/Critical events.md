The only real critical event i had during my intern was my final presentation, the Tuesday of my last week. 
I had to present everything that i did, explaining how i manage to solve the initials challenges we had, and presenting the final result. I also had to explain how people could use my work. 
as explained i mainly work on [[Expected deliverables#ProteusToolBox|ProteusToolbox]]. I thus had to explain how developers can upload their python application on the store. This involve some constraints on application and explaing the application publish process. 
The preparation of this presentation and the last part especially was a bit stressful as the previous Friday, my supervisor decided to changes the upload process and the control over the published application. It was hard to technically implement those changes while adapting the documentation and preparing the presentation. Because until i completely implemented the publish process, it's hard to give clear explanation of what people need to do.
Moreover, i was seek during this week so it was hard to decide how to manage this situation. I didn't want to reschedule the presentation so I had to deal with illness.
But in the end, i receive a lot of positive feedback on the presentation and on my overall work during my intern.
