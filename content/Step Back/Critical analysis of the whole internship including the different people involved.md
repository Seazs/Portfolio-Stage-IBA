# Experience

- Positive aspect
	- I liked the whole work environement (way more enjoyable and less toxic that i thought, with no boss coming to add task to people (it's specific to the team as they don't really have a boss in the team but they recieve requirements and directive from other teams, but there isn't a hierarchical difference between the 2 team)).
	- Learned a lot of different technical skills, from deepen my python overall skills, learn how to make graphical application on python, how to make easy to reuse code, etc... i learned all the automation pipeline of GitLab (that can easily be exported to other platform as it is the same principle). I learn How to make InnoSetup installer. All sort of things that i couldn't do before and with wich i feel confortable now.
	- Liked the entreprise and the main mission of IBA. I feel that working in a company that have a real purpose that's meaningful is important as it's a source of motivation and devotion. 
- Negative aspect
		- I don't feel that working as a pure developer is what drives me the most. It didn't bother me to work any day of the internship, but i didn't feel a lot of motivation as i didn't find the subject so interesting. I didn't find enough challenges and problems to solve as i use to have in more engineer driven project. Here, it's was just about implementing what we want. Even if sometimes there were problems, it was always more computer problems and implementation problems that the solution itself.
		- As i worked on a non-product software on my own, i have not been able to fully experiment the enterprise work. Even i worked beside my teams member, i was never include in the product development process, with all responsibilities and knowledge that it requires. I would have loved to experiment the developpement workflow, to learn about their GitFlow (how to use git to develop a produc in a safe manner) and the all merge request proccess (merging a git branch in the main one when a feature is ready to be pulished). Passing to more peer reviewing would certainly have though me a lot on my programming skills.
		- I did improve my programming skills but by my own, i have rarely been subject to peer reviewing. I think maybe 3 times during the whole intern. (It was always very instructive), what i find little (It does take time so i understand them if it's not important for the main product).

# Adrien

Adrien was my supervisor throughout the internship. He really took me under his wing and provided constant support with each task I needed to complete, making sure I was never stuck or lacking any resources. We had many discussions, and he was fully invested in my project, which was incredibly generous considering the time he dedicated to it.

We often had lunch together, and he never once overlooked or neglected me.

Adrien also frequently provided technical support on my project, offering potential solutions to obstacles I encountered. His experience in software and expertise in Python were immensely helpful.


The only feedback I have is that Adrien and I are quite similar in our approach. Personally, I tend to focus heavily on the technical aspects of a project without stepping back to consider what I’m doing, why I’m doing it, and in what direction the project should go.

As a result, I sometimes spent time working on tasks that weren't necessarily valuable for the project or useful for end users.

I feel I would benefit from having someone who occasionally pushes me to take a step back and assess the purpose of the task I'm working on. It would also be helpful to be encouraged to explain what I’m working on and share my challenges, as this would likely help me solve issues more quickly and improve my productivity.
