This internship prompted me to reflect on the type of job I want to pursue. As explained in [[Critical analysis of the whole internship including the different people involved#Positive Aspects|Critical analysis]], I realized that a purely developer role may not be my greatest passion. I am more inclined towards working in engineering fields such as robotics or artificial intelligence.

Similarly, the internship led me to consider what kind of company I would like to work for. Should I aim for a position directly within a company like IBA, where I might spend a significant portion of my career? Or would it be more beneficial to start in consulting, allowing me to experience various fields and companies while gaining valuable experience?

These are questions I discussed with several colleagues, who shared their positive and negative experiences in consulting and offered insights into what I should consider as an employee in a consulting firm.

I believe that my experience in consulting would heavily depend on the firm I choose, the manager I work with, the company Iâ€™m assigned to, and the projects I undertake.

They also mentioned that joining a company and gradually gaining expertise in that field, leading to increased responsibilities, is also a valuable approach. Being a consultant for 6 to 12-month assignments means constantly being a novice, especially regarding the specifics of each company. This often results in having fewer responsibilities compared to long-term employees who have a deeper understanding of the organization.
