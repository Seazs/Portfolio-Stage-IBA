During my internship, my primary focus was enhancing a single application, which became the main deliverable with a set deadline. My objective was to deliver a fully functional application that met all specified requirements. After the initial week or two, I had the opportunity to dive into the online documentation. At first glance, I felt confident that I could complete the application relatively quickly.
Indeed, after two weeks, I began running small implementation tests with some solutions I had identified for the problem. These initial tests brought me quite far, which led me to believe I might be able to complete the work ahead of schedule.

However, I didn’t anticipate having to revise the application’s architecture multiple times, or spending significant time on additional components that extended beyond the main project. Additionally, the required features evolved considerably throughout the internship, which added unexpected complexity to the work.

Even in the final week, my supervisor decided to add one last change. This led me to keep working on the application and its documentation until the very last moment of my internship.

In the end, I believe I delivered a product that is thorough, functional, and detailed enough for others to use and continue improving.
